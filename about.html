            <b>Wanlin Cao</b>,former IC design center of the ministry of electronics, is an advanced individual in the national 7.5 program. 
			He participated in the national key project "Panda VLSI-CAD System" and won the first prize of national science and technology progress.
			Later, He,the core R&D staff of Confromal LEC,was engaged in VLSI optimization and verification in Fujitsu American Institute and VerplexAfter,
			which is still the industry standard. In 2005,he founded Formalogic, which is used by two American companies and a American university.
			Since then, he has been engaged in low-energy optimization and FPGA development in Pwrlite and Xilinx, 
			and reduced the dynamic power consumption of Xilinx V6/V7/S7 series chips by 21%. 
			This product is far superior to that of Synopsys and Calypto.
			From 2012 to 2013, he began to work as Art Semiconductor Software Director and led more than 20 people in Silicon Valley/Shanghai/Jinan to develop FPGA system.
